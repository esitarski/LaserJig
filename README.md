# LaserJig
Bike Jig using lasers.  Designed to be non-portable used in a fixed location (i.e. a velodrome).  The intent
is for riders to check their own bikes.  As such, jig is designed to be bomb-proof as it will be subject to
use and abuse for years while remaining extremely accurate.

Plywood parts extracted from OpenSCAD via extract.py and output in dxf and svg files.
These files can then be used to drive a digital router table which can cut the parts out of 19mm birch plywood.

The design is parameterized in all key dimensions so it is easy to change for different laser modules etc.

Requires OpenSCAD and Python 3.
