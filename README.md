# LaserJig
Bike Jig using lasers (non-portable).

OpenSCAD design for a bike jig to check for UCI compliance.
Parts from the OpenSCAD parts are then output in dxf and svg files to be cut on a digital router table out of 19mm birch plywood.

All parts of the design are parameterized so it is easy to change for different laser modules etc.

This project requires OpenSCAD and Python 3.
